kubectl describe pod PODNAME
1. check if it is running or not
2. if it is pending, it might be due to 
   a. not enough resources
   b. you are using hostPort
3. if it is waiting then it is scheduled to a node but can't run.
   most common reason is the image pulling from the docker registry.
4. if it keeps crashing then analyze the logs of the pod
kubectl logs PODNAME CONTAINERNAME
5. my pod is running but not doing the assigned job
  might be because of an error in the yaml file
6. debug RC and Services
   make sure that number of endpoints are matching number of pods
7. make sure that port assignment is done properly for the network to work.
